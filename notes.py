#supervised machine learning - works with labeled data
#unsupervised machine learning - works with unlabelled data
# supervised falls into two categories
#1. classification
#2. Regression
# The data is structured i Rows and columns
# each row represents a sample, in supervised machine learning each row has a label called target
# The colunks represent the feature of the sample

# classification models - ordinal data
# regresssion models - Continous output

# Unsupervised machine learning - clustering algorithms
